# The-Times-Over-Time
Using NLP to examine prevalent topics of front page New York Times articles from 1981 through 2016.  For more details, see [this blog post](https://sravi2421.github.io/The_Times_Over_Time/) which was written in 2017. Analysis is currently being refreshed with cleaner code and a new perspective. Once the analysis is complete, the corresponding blog post will also be refreshed.

This repository contains the code needed to replicate the analysis done. Contained within this repo are three folders:

1. Data Pull - contains notebooks and scraps script used to pull the raw text of articles from the NY Times and then preprocess this data for analysis
2. Clustering - contains notebooks to cluster and subcluster the articles and then provide summary visualizations of the outcome of these methods
3. Word Clouds/Sentiment Analysis - contains notebooks and analysis on word associations
